I hinted at [LambdaJam Australia][2] back in my [2012 Highlights post][1] and the dates are fast approaching so I thought appropriate to blog about it once more.

[YOW! LambdaJam][2] is a conference targeted at intermediate and advanced functional programmers and is organised in talks, jams and workshops.

- **Talks** are the traditional format and are 30 minutes long;
- **Workshops** aim to introduce a specific subjects to attendees in great detail and are up to two hours long;
- **Jams** are hands-on sessions. Participants will be guided through pre-defined problems around a given subject/technology and encouraged to work through the solutions either by themselves or ideally as small groups. Jams are also 2 hours long;

Sounds pretty amazing, doesn't it?

If you're still not convinced, check out the [program][3].

The conference will run for 2 days, May 16-17, in Brisbane. [Tickets are on sale][4].

### Clojure

Besides the conference itself, [Clojure/core][5] will be giving an Intro to Clojure workshop in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. It's a great opportunity to learn from the language maintainers.

If you're attending the conference already, you're in luck because there is a 20% off discount [on the link above][4] if you attend both the conference and the workshop.

In case you'd like to attend the workshops only, you can buy individual tickets for [Sydney][6], [Melbourne][7] and [Brisbane][8].


### Scala

[Tony Morris][9] will also be delivering a Functional Programming in Scala workshop in Brisbane and 20% off combo tickets can be bought from the [EventBrite page for LambdaJam][4].


### See you there

Got tickets yet? No? What are you waiting for?
