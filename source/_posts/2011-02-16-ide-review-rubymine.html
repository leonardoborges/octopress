Since I started working with Ruby about 4 years ago, I've used quite a few text editors and ide's: <a href="http://www.aptana.com/products/radrails">RadRails</a>, <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/" target="_blank">gedit</a> + <a href="https://github.com/lexrupy/gmate" target="_blank">plugins</a>, <a href="http://macromates.com/" target="_blank">TextMate</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">Vim</a>.<br><br>TextMate is the one I've used the most and it's been ok for a long time. Until you realize you need half a dozen bundles to make it really useful for ruby development. Obviously the same goes for Vim and gedit.<br><br>Oh, and forget about refactoring. In these tools refactoring equals regex global replace. So if you need it, well, forget it.<br><br>That's when I decided to give <strong><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/" target="_blank">RubyMine</a></strong> a fair go. I've been using it heavily for a while now and I must say I love it!<br><br>What pissed me off about RadRails when I first tried it was the speed. It was too slow, something people take for granted when running java based IDE's.<br><br>However this is not true for RubyMine. You DO take a hit on startup, nothing major, but once it's done, it's a breeze.<br><br>I've compiled a list of my favorite productivity shortcuts and features. Hope it'll be useful to someone else.<br><br><strong>Productivity Shortcuts</strong><br><br><hr /><strong>Navigation</strong><br><br><em>Ctrl + Tab</em> - File Switcher<br><br><em>Cmd + Shift + T</em> - Switching between implementation and test works perfectly. Even in a pure ruby project<br><br><em>Cmd + Shift + F12</em> - Expand/restore editor<br><br><em>Alt + Shift + N</em> - Go to model/view/controller<br><br><em>Alt + F1</em> - Show current file in other views such as the project tree (scroll to file)<br><br><em>Cmd + Shift + N</em> - Open file<br><br><em>Cmd + Alt + Shift + N</em> - Open symbol - across files<br><br><em>Alt + F7</em> - Find usages - when on a method, variable, etc…<br><br><strong>Running/Debugging</strong><br><br><em>Ctrl + Shift + F10</em> - Run current [test] file. When inside a test method, run that single method.<br><br><em>Ctrl + Shift + F9</em> - Same as above, but in debug mode.<br><br><em>Shift + F10/Shift + F9</em> - Run/Debug last action executed<br><br><em>Alt + R</em> - Run rake task<br><br><strong>Refactoring</strong><br><br><em>Cmd + Alt + N</em> - Inline variable/ method<br><br><em>Cmd + Alt + M</em> - Extract method<br><br><em>Shift + F6</em> - Rename<br><br><em>F5</em> - Copy current file as...<br><br><strong>Editing</strong><br><br><em> Cmd + Y</em> - Delete line<br><br><em>Cmd + D</em> - Duplicate Line/Selection<br><br><em>Alt + Mouse</em> - Column selection<br><br><em>Cmd + Shift + (Up Arrow|Down Arrow)</em> - Moves de line or selected block of code up or down<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><br><hr /><em>Code completion</em> - It's fairly accurate and pretty fast. They've done some good yak shaving around this area.<br><br><em>Debugger</em> - The debugging interface is an absolute beauty. Saved me a lot of time where I'd have used puts statements or googled to re-learn how to use ruby-debug instead. Definitely worth checking out.<br><br><strong>The bad stuff</strong><br><br><hr /><em>It is not free</em> - unless you are a committer to an open-source project. But it's not expensive either.<br><br><em>It is a bit slower</em> - but not that much. The performance hit is insignificant compared to the added value.<br><br><em>Regex file open, TextMate style</em> - What can I say? I do miss this.<br><br><em>Wrap highlighted text</em> - In TextMate, if you highlight a word and press ", [, {, ( or # it surrounds the word with the respective combination of quotes, brackets, etc... Another missed feature<br><br><strong>Wrapping up</strong><br>It's probably soon to say it but so far RubyMine has been my missing Ruby IDE. And I'm very happy with it. :)
