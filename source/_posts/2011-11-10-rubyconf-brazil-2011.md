I was in São Paulo last week - the 3rd and 4th of November - for [RubyConf Brazil](http://rubyconf.com.br). For those who don't know, RubyConf Brazil is the evolution of Rails Summit Latin America, where [I had the privilege to speak in 2009](http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2009/10/18/my-slides-from-rails-summit-09/). 

This year though, all bets were off. [Fabio Akita](http://akitaonrails.com) and [Locaweb](http://www.locaweb.com/) put together a great event, with over 700 attendees and about 30 speakers split in two streams and two awesome days.

Once more I had the chance to speak at the event and different from previous years, all talks were recorded and streamed live! You can check mine - in portuguese - [here](http://www.eventials.com/rubyconfbr/recorded/M2UzZTJkMzY2MzdiNTg2NTUxNWM1MzI3NWY1YjRhMzYjIzM4Mg_3D_3D) as well as my slides - in english - [on slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/borgesleonardo/clouds-against-the-floods-rubyconfbr2011).

All other talks can be watched from the [eventials' RubyConf Brazil page](http://www.eventials.com/rubyconfbr). Locaweb has also published the official [Flickr album](http://www.flickr.com/photos/locaweb/sets/72157628091808954/) of the event.

It was great to meet up with great friends again as well as to meet amazing new people such as the guys from ThoughtWorks Brazil. I promise I'll make the detour next time! :)

I hope to see you all again soon!
