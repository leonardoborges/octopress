It's that time of the year to look back at what you've done and either be happy about it or... well not. :)

To me anyway 2011 was a great year but I won't bore you with the details so I'll just jump straight into a couple of highlights!

The biggest one of course was the project we developed to help the [Queensland flood victims back in January][3] - which brings me to the next topic:

### Speaking

Said project gave me the chance to speak at a few events, sharing this and other great stories:

- Ruby On Rails Oceania User Group - Sydney - February ([slides][5] | [video][6])
- CloudCamp - Sydney - July ([slides][5])
- XConf (1) Australia - Melbourne - August
- RubyConf Brazil - Sao Paulo - November ([slides][8] | [video][7])

(1) - XConf is an internal technical conference here at ThoughtWorks

### Content

Here in the blog, these are a few of the most popular articles for 2011:

- [Why I Like Ruby #1: Alias_method][1] - This one still surprises me. It's been at the top for a while
- [IDE Review: RubyMine][2]
- [Clouds against the Floods][3]
- [One Year of ThoughtWorks: A Retrospective][4]

### Languages

I decided to learn Clojure and started an internal user group at ThoughtWorks Sydney - you can read a brief report on our first [here][9]. 

The group's been a bit off lately since I was on leave in Brazil and then the whole holiday season happened but it's definitely one of the things I want to make happen more often in the new year.

Clojure is a great language and I expect it to keep gaining a lot of traction in 2012.


### And I guess that's it... 

A lot more happened in the last 12 months but these are definitely my favourite parts.

Happy new year everyone! I'm sure 2012 has a lot of new challenges and surprises for us :D
