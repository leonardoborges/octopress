<a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger(mod_rails)</a> has been released.<br><br>The idea is to ease the pain on rails applications deployment. I tested myself and in less than five minutes I had my application working behind Apache!<br><br>I'm not going to say much here besides the fact that it seems like a really good option for rails deployment and <a href="http://www.modrails.com/testimonials.html">people</a> have been talking about it already, including <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">DHH</a>.<br><br>But I do recommend a read on the <a href="http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Architectural%20overview.html">architecture overview</a> document. Be sure to read it all, specially the part on <a href="http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Architectural%20overview.html#concurrent_requests">handling concurrent requests</a>.<br><br>To install, "it doesn't get easier than" <a href="http://www.modrails.com/install.html">that</a>.<br><br>Good job guys.
