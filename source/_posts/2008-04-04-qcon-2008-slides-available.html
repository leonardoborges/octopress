<p>
Most of last QCon's presentations are available for download <a href="http://jaoo.dk/london-2008/schedule">here</a>.<br><br>Highlights to Ola Bini's on <a href="http://jaoo.dk/london-2008/file?path=/qcon-london-2008/slides/OlaBini_JRuby_Power_on_the_JVM.pdf">JRuby(pdf)</a> and Randy Shoup's on  <a href="http://jaoo.dk/london-2008/file?path=/qcon-london-2008/slides/RandyShoup_eBaysArchitecturalPrinciples.pdf">eBay's architectural principles(pdf)</a>.<br><br>And while we're talking about JRuby, it's impressive how it's becoming a recurrent and big subject. Fast. It had its own small space at big event like QCon and in the last Euruko in Prague, we had a presentation by the JRuby Core Developers <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/">Charles Nutter</a> and <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/ThomasEEnebo">Thomas Enebo</a>.<br><br>Big companies are sponsoring JRuby's development indirectly or directly, like <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun</a>. And other big companies are endorsing its production ready state, like <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a>, which has a publicly available website developed with JRuby On Rails.<br><br>It's past the time to give it a serious try...
