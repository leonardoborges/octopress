I finally got some free time so sit down and write this post. I was travelling with my girlfriend around the state of
Victoria, Australia - mostly around the [Great Ocean Road](http://www.visitvictoria.com/Regions/great-ocean-road). I had an amazing time and it's a trip
I highly recommend anyone do.

As for this year's highlights, let's get started:

## Clojure

[clj-syd](http://www.meetup.com/clj-syd/) - the Sydney Clojure User Group - continues going strong and this is in great part thanks to the amazing community behind it.
You can have a look at our [wiki page for 2013](https://github.com/clj-syd/clj-syd/wiki/2013) to see what we've been up to.

A major highlight is the fact that we brought [Ambrose Bonnaire-Sergeant](https://twitter.com/ambrosebs) - creator of [core.typed](https://github.com/clojure/core.typed) - to Sydney to give a talk on his creation. You can read a summary of the talk on [our mailing list](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/to%3Aclj-syd%40googlegroups.com/1428350a8e888375).

On a more personal note I've been basically living in Melbourne for the past ~6 months working on a full-time Clojure project. I have learned a lot and can't wait to share a whole lot with the group once I'm back in Sydney.

## Speaking

I was fortunate enough to speak at a couple of really cool events this year as well as a few user group talks. Here they are:

- [Functional Reactive Programming in Clojurescript](http://www.slideshare.net/borgesleonardo/functional-reactive-programming-in-clojurescript) - LambdaJam, May 2013 - Brisbane, Australia

- [Clojure macros workshop](http://www.slideshare.net/borgesleonardo/clojure-macros-workshop-lambdajam-2013-cufp-2013) - LambdaJam, May 2013 - Brisbane, Australia / CUFP, October 2013 - Boston, USA

- [Intro to core.async](http://www.slideshare.net/borgesleonardo/intro-to-clojures-coreasync) - #cljsyd - Sydney, Australia & #cljmelb - Melbourne, Australia

I have also attended Clojure/West in Portland back in March. Great conference, great content and amazing people. I put together some slides with my notes [on SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/borgesleonardo/clojurewest-2013-in-30-mins).


## Books

2013 was a great year for Clojure as we saw quite a few new books be released during the year. I'll briefly mention a couple:

#### [Clojure Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029786.do)

As the authors describe it: *"Clojure Cookbook marks Clojure's entry in O'Reilly's prestigious Cookbook Series. The book will contain hundreds of real-world problems and solutions, ranging from basic utilities to rich web services to heavy data processing."*

I have contributed three recipes to this book so I'm quite happy to see them make it in. You can buy the early digital edition from [O'Reilly's website](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029786.do).

The book is the main effort of authors [Luke Vanderhart](https://twitter.com/levanderhart) and [Ryan Neufeld](https://twitter.com/rkneufeld) with contributions from the Clojure community around the globe.
They've put together quite the selection.

#### [Clojure Recipes](http://clojurerecipes.net/)

Shameless plug of one of #cljsyd's regulars, [Julian Gamble](https://twitter.com/juliansgamble), who's been working on this for a while. The book should be released at the end of January 2014 and I'm looking forward to it.

#### [Clojure High Performance Programming](http://www.packtpub.com/clojure-high-performance-programming/book)

I've only just started reading it but I already like what I see enough to mention it here.


## Content

Here's the Top 3 posts from this blog in 2013:

- [Clojure and 'Why Calculating Is Better Than Scheming'](http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2013/03/25/clojure-and-why-calculating-is-better-than-scheming/) - A fresh look at this popular paper by [Philip Wadler](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/) from a Clojure perspective.

- [Clojure, core.async and the Lisp Advantage](http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2013/07/06/clojure-core-dot-async-lisp-advantage/) - This year saw much excitement around Clojure's [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) library and this post gives a brief introduction as to what it's all about.

- [Purely Functional Data Structures in Clojure: Red-Black Trees](http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2013/07/15/purely-functional-data-structures-in-clojure-red-black-trees/) - This post is from a series - though I only have two posts at the moment - about [persistent data structures](http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2013/07/15/purely-functional-data-structures-in-clojure-red-black-trees/) in Clojure.


## Non-tech news

For those who know me my passion for sports - such as martial arts, rock climbing and strength training - is no secret and in 2013 I became a certified personal trainer in Australia. I did this mostly for personal development and to better my own training. The certification is already paying off. It was a great course.


**Happy new year! Here's to an even better one ahead of us!**
