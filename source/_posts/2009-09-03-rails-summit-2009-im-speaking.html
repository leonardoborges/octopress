It will be a good opportunity to meet some <a href="http://railssummit.com.br/en/speakers">amazing people</a> and visit friends back home! :)<br><br>Overall I'll be spending 12 days in Brazil, with 2 of them dedicated to the conference. The other 10 I'll be in Rio de Janeiro visiting my family and friends. I strongly advise you to spend some time in Rio too, if at all possible. It's an amazing city and you can contact me if you have any questions.<br><br>Back to the conference, my session is called <strong>JRuby in the enterprise world: Using Rails with legacy code</strong>, and will be given in the form of a tutorial. I will walk you through some problems we had while making this kind of integration at my company, focusing mostly on dependency management.<br><br>At the end I hope you'll have a good understanding of what JRuby is capable of in a legacy environment.<br><br>If you're planning to attend and would like to hear anything specific about JRuby, please let me know, I can try and squeeze in.<br><br>C u there!
