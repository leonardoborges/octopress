  Of course some of you may not like it. But I think it has more advantages than the other way ...

Well, talking with some friends, I decided that, from now on, I shall only write in english on this blog.<br><br>Of course some of you may not like it. But I think it has more advantages than the other way around.Â  I have some friends around the world, including people from the U.S., Spain, Italy, China, India and Australia. This way, they can also enjoy the content of this blog and help me improve it.<br><br>I will keep writing on the same subjects, so feel free to comment, as always. You may comment in the language you like more - hey, I can't read Japanese! - but english is highly preferable! ;)<br><br>Thanks and see you on my next post!
