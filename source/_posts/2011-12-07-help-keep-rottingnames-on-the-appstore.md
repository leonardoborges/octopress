title: "Help Keep RottingNames On The Appstore"
---


A year ago I decided to try my hand on iPhone software development and created a very simple application to experience the whole lifecycle of putting a complete project on the Apple AppStore - [I wrote about it a while back](http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2011/03/19/rottingnames-for-iphone-available-for-free/). 

The result was [RottingNames](http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/rottingnames/id413043377?mt=8), a heavy metal band name generator. 

Since then, I haven't developed anything else for the iPhone - mostly because my interest lies elsewhere now - but I did notice a small yet steady amount of downloads for this cool little app.

You can download [RottingNames](http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/rottingnames/id413043377?mt=8) for free from the App Store and I like keeping it that way.

However, to be able to put an application on the AppStore, Apple charges an annual fee of A$99 - even if the application itself is free. 

I had decided not to renew my iOS Developer Program membership but it seems a pity to let RottingNames vanish like this. Es	pecially knowing there are a few die-hard fans out there having a good laugh with it.

Here's the deal: I'm asking for A$99 in order to renew the membership. 

In return, RottingNames will stay on the AppStore for another year, for free.

So hit the button below and stay metal! \m/
