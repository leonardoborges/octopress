It's been now over a week since we moved to Sydney and everything is just great. We're still house hunting but I got a feeling we'll have a home soon. :)<br><br>In the meantime, this morning I got a feature request on github to allow <a href="http://github.com/leonardoborges/app_constants" target="_blank">AppConstants</a> to interpret YAML files with embedded code like this:<br><br><script src="https://gist.github.com/790877.js?file=gistfile1.yml"></script><br><br>I haven't needed it myself but thought it would be a nice addition so my <a href="http://github.com/leonardoborges/app_constants/commit/7c116c8cf9307942f7d8682779510e623156fd08">latest commit</a> does exactly that. Let me know if you find any issues.
