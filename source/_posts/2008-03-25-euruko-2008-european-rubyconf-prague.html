On friday I'll be heading Prague for the <a href="http://www.euruko2008.org/">European RubyConf</a>.<br><br>Anyone is going? :)<br><br>Almost 300 attendees already registered for the event. And a few very interesting people will be speaking there like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto">Matz</a> and <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">DHH</a> (this one, through skype).<br><br>Besides that, the organization staff is scheduling 2 parties, friday and saturday, for the attendees.<br><br>Networking comes to mind, doesn't it? I think it will be a great opportunity to meet interesting and bright people.<br><br>So, see u in Prague!
