Another year is about to end and as it is tradition in this blog it's time to look at the year's highlights!


## Functional Programming

I have been advocating Functional Programming and Clojure for a while now and 2014 has been good to me. It was the first year where I was paid to work almost entirely in functional languages. Most of it was in Scala and a little less in Clojure.

I did have a short 8-week gig in Javascript but even then I tried to make it as functional as possible - e.g.: making use of Reactive Programming techniques ([Rx-style](http://reactivex.io/))

I'm also thankful for the opportunity to have organised the first Sydney edition of [ClojureBridge](http://www.clojurebridge.org/), a workshop aimed at increasing diversity in the Clojure community by delivering free workshops for women. You can read more about what we did on the day [here](http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2014/12/22/clojurebridge-sydney/).

Another bit of exciting news is that I've decided to quit [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/). Starting in January I'll be doing Clojure full-time at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/). I've written about it [here](http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2014/12/27/staring-a-new-chapter/).

I'm looking forward to a very functional year!

## Writing

Early this year I was invited by [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/) to write a book on Reactive Programming in Clojure. I've [announced it before in this blog](http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2014/07/20/euroclojure-2014-and-clojure-reactive-programming/) but it is definitely a highlight of this year.

The [book](https://twitter.com/CljReactiveProg) has been a while in the making and I had no idea of the amount of effort involved in writing one. I'm mostly content-complete now but working through a number of useful bits of feedback I got from early reviewers. I expect to be done with these in January and then the book should go into production.

I'll keep everybody posted :)

## Reading

Most of what I read this year - with the little free time I had - were academic papers and I would like to highlight a few that I particularly enjoyed:

  - [Monads for functional programming](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf)
  - [Propositions as Types](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf)
  - [Theorems for free!](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~dreyer/course/papers/wadler.pdf)
  - [Monoids: Theme and Variations (Functional Pearl)](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/pub/monoid-pearl.pdf)
  - [Functional Reactive Animation](http://conal.net/papers/icfp97/icfp97.pdf)
  - [Push-pull Functional Reactive Programming](http://conal.net/papers/push-pull-frp/push-pull-frp.pdf)
  - [Elm: Concurrent FRP for Functional GUIs](http://elm-lang.org/papers/concurrent-frp.pdf)

Additionally I can't help myself and recommend that you read [Functional Programming in Scala](http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/) if you have any interest in FP and  Scala. [Rúnar](https://twitter.com/runarorama) and [Paul](https://twitter.com/pchiusano) have done a great job and put a lot of good advice in this book.

## Speaking

Between work and writing the book I'm happy I managed to speak this much:


  - The Algebra of Library Design (no slides but more about it soon) - Sydney Clojure User Group, October 2014 - Sydney, Australia
  - [High Performance web apps in Om, React and ClojureScript](http://www.slideshare.net/borgesleonardo/high-performance-web-apps-in-om-react-and-clojurescript) - LambdaJam, May 2014 - Brisbane, Australia
  - [Taming asynchronous workflows with Functional Reactive Programming](http://www.slideshare.net/borgesleonardo/functional-reactive-programming-compositional-event-systems) - EuroClojure, April 2014 - Krakow, Poland 
  - [Taming asynchronous workflows with Functional Reactive Programming (portuguese)](http://www.slideshare.net/borgesleonardo/programao-functional-reativa-lidando-com-cdigo-assncrono) - QCon, March 2014 - São Paulo, Brazil
  - [Monads in Clojure](http://www.slideshare.net/borgesleonardo/monads-in-clojure) - Sydney Clojure User Group, February 2014 - Sydney, Australia


## Content

Here's the Top 5 posts from this blog in 2014:

- [Functional Composition With Monads, Kleislis and Functors](http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2014/06/17/functional-composition-with-monads-kleisli-functors/) - With learning Scala and Scalaz, I've come to learn new ways of composing programs. This short post is a brief look on one of them, Kleisli arrows.

- [Monads in Small Bites - Part I - Functors](http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2012/11/30/monads-in-small-bites-part-i-functors/) - I'm pleasantly surprised this post ranked this high. It's from a series about Monads and I'm glad it has been helping people understand the general idea behind them.

- [Clojure and 'Why Calculating Is Better Than Scheming'](http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2013/03/25/clojure-and-why-calculating-is-better-than-scheming/) - A fresh look at this popular paper by [Philip Wadler](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/) from a Clojure perspective.

- [Clojure, core.async and the Lisp Advantage](http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2013/07/06/clojure-core-dot-async-lisp-advantage/) - [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) is still all the rage in the Clojure community and this post from 2013 gives a brief introduction as to what it's all about.

- [Purely Functional Data Structures in Clojure: Red-Black Trees](http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2013/07/15/purely-functional-data-structures-in-clojure-red-black-trees/) - This post is from a series - though I only have two posts at the moment - about [persistent data structures](http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2013/07/15/purely-functional-data-structures-in-clojure-red-black-trees/) in Clojure.

If this tells me anything it's that I need to blog more!



**Happy new year! Here's to an amazing 2015!**
