<strong>Update:</strong> The service is now down while we move it from the VPS provided by Rails Rumble to our own. I'll let you know once it's up.<br><br>Last weekend <a href="http://www.ivercore.com/" target="_blank">Philip</a>, <a href="http://www.pedropimentel.com/" target="_blank">Pedro</a> and myself got together for this year's <a href="http://railsrumble.com/" target="_blank">Rails Rumble</a>.<br><br>We haven't had really decided what to do until a few days before the competition, but I had this really simple idea and decided to go with it. Seems people liked it, given a few positive comments we received.<br><br>So, after 48 hours - which were not used to work full-time in the application - <a href="http://birdwatcher.r09.railsrumble.com/">The Bird Watcher</a> was born.<br><br><a href="http://birdwatcher.r09.railsrumble.com/">The Bird Watcher</a> is a simple way to show the world what's going on on Twitter for any topic you define.Â  Go ahead and take a look at the website to see a live example.<br><br>We're planning to keep the service up after the competition is over and we have some nice features lined up to go live on the next release.<br><br>In short, it was an interesting weekend and showed me that this team works really well together.<br><br>Cheers
