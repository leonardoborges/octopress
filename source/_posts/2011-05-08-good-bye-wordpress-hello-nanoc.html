<p>
  I just finished migrating my blog from wordpress to <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/" target="_blank">nanoc</a>
  using a <a href="https://github.com/leonardoborges/nanoc3_blog" target="_blank">customized version</a> of <a href="https://github.com/mgutz/nanoc3_blog/" target="_blank">nanoc3_blog</a>
  and it feels nice.
  <br>
  I grew tired of keeping up with Wordpress' updates and this migration also means that I can finally get rid of php on
  my vps.
</p>

<p>
  However, do let me know if there is anything weird around here. The whole customization done on nanoc3_blog was
  related to the wordpress migration.
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  I wanted to make sure all url's stayed the same so as to avoid broken links into the blog. Feel free to browse the
  <a href="https://github.com/leonardoborges/nanoc3_blog" target="_blank">repository</a> and see if the changes can be helpful to you.
  <br>
  It also includes a modified version of a wordpress import script that was responsible for keeping the links correct, among other things.
</p>
<p>
  I'll try and document the changes I made so people can easily cherry pick what they want.
