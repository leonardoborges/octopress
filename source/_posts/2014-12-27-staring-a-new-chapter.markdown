## Thanks, ThoughtWorks

After 4 years and 8 months I have made the hard decision to change jobs: Friday, 19th of December, was my last day at [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/). 

In this time I have made many friends and have grown a lot as a professional. Consulting presents so many new challenges that often times the technical problems you are trying to solve are the easiest part of the whole project. I am thankful for that.

I am also thankful for the opportunities I've had. 

A few years ago I started dedicating most, if not all, my free time to learning Functional Programming. ThoughtWorks supported and encouraged my endeavours in doing so and that is a big part of enabling me to create and grow the Clojure community in Sydney through [#cljsyd](http://www.meetup.com/clj-syd/). 

Additionally ThoughtWorks has also recognised the importance of Functional Programming in modern software development and allowed me to work almost exclusively in FP languages such as Scala and Clojure for the past year and a half.

About three years ago I [wrote a post](http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2011/04/25/one-year-of-thoughtworks-a-retrospective/) detailing my first year at ThoughtWorks. Much of it is still true so there is no point in repeating it. ThoughtWorks remains a great place to work.


## What's next?

My next challenge will be at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/), an Australian Software company best known for being the creators of [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence), [Stash](https://www.atlassian.com/software/stash) and [many other products](https://www.atlassian.com/software).

Over the years I have met several Atlassians - that's what they call themselves - and many of them have been heavily involved in the Functional Programming community. So when I was contacted by a friend saying Atlassian needed an experienced Clojure developer I was intrigued.

A few months ago Atlassian acquired [WikiDocs](https://wikidocs.com/), a startup whose business is to build technology that enables [real-time collaborative editing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_real-time_editor). It turns out that this product is developed in Clojure and Clojurescript. That's essentially what I'm going to be working on - I'll write more about it once I settle in.

When I started learning Clojure over 3 years ago, little did I know that I'd be working full-time with the language so soon and I am super excited about it. It's great to see that much effort paying off like this.

My start date at Atlassian is the 5th of January and I am looking forward to meeting a bunch of great people and making new friends.
