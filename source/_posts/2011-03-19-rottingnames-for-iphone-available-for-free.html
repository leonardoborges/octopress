Following the staggering success of the online version of <a href="http://rottingnames.heroku.com">RottingNames</a> - where by success I mean the handful of metal heads constantly using the app :) - I released the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/rottingnames/id413043377?mt=8">iPhone version for free </a>. You can now generate crazy and fun names anywhere! Go <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/rottingnames/id413043377?mt=8">get it</a>!<br><br>I've been meaning to post this for Â a while but I was waiting to have some free time and add a few new features to the app, which I just realised won't happen any time soon given the priorities I have at the moment. But by all means feel free to drop a line if you're dying about a missing feature.<br><br>Now go have fun ;)
