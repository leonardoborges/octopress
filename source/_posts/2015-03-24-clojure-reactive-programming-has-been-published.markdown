I'm extremely happy to let everyone know my book, [Clojure Reactive Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/clojure-reactive-programming), has finally been published!

You can get it at the [publisher's website](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/clojure-reactive-programming) or on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Reactive-Programming-Leonardo-Borges/dp/1783986662/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1427205216&sr=8-1&keywords=Clojure+Reactive+Programming). I had a great time writing it and I truly hope you find it useful!

I've met a few authors here and there and I heard more than once that a book is never really finished. I now know what they mean. 

The book doesn't cover everything I wanted to write about due to time and space limitations. Having said that, now that the book is out I do plan to expand on a few things using this blog.

Stay tuned!

Thanks to everyone who gave me feedback on early drafts of the book! :)
