This is just another one of those boring weekends where I felt the need to hack on something.<br><br>If you follow Google Chrome's <a title="Chrome's blog" href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> you're probably aware of this little nifty feature they started to implement in their latest builds: <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2011/03/talking-to-your-computer-with-html5.html" target="_blank">HTML5 voice recognition</a>.<br><br>And that's when it struck me: "Hey, what if I use that and tweet with my voice instead of typing?"<br><br>The result of this hacking session is <a href="http://loudparrot.heroku.com/">LoudParrot</a>, a sample Rails app that shows how to do just that. You <strong>will</strong> need a fairly recent build of Google Chrome -beta - which you can download <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/chrome/beta/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>You can get the source on <a href="https://github.com/leonardoborges/loud-parrot">GitHub</a>.
