Once more my life is taking a huge turn.<br><br>I've been pretty quiet for the past month and honestly don't know how I managed to hold in my excitement. I've just accepted an offer from <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com.au/" target="_blank">ThoughtWorks</a> to be based at their australian offices, either in Sydney or Melbourne, depending  on where my 1st project will be.<br><br>For those of you who don't know, ThoughtWorks is a global IT consultancy that is really well known in the software development community. It's been advocating agile methodologies and test-driven development for several years now and seems to work really hard to attract and keep <a title="Martin Fowler" href="http://www.martinfowler.com" target="_blank">many</a> <a title="Rebecca Parsons" href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/who-we-are/leadership-profiles/rebecca-parsons.html" target="_blank">bright</a> <a title="Neal Ford" href="http://www.nealford.com/" target="_blank">people</a> <a title="Ola Bini" href="http://olabini.com/" target="_blank">working</a> <a title="All ThoughtWorkers" href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/who-we-are/our-people/profiles.html" target="_blank">there</a>.<br><br>As a result, ThoughtWorks inspires companies and professionals around the world by delivering high quality projects and massively supporting/contributing to <a title="Projects created/contributed to by ThoughtWorks" href="http://opensource.thoughtworks.com" target="_blank">open source projects</a>.<br><br>Needless to say, I am really excited to be joining a company with such an amazing culture and so many smart people.<br><br>The hiring process was long, tough and tiring - but yet enjoyable. It took 5 interviews, 1 code review and 1 pairing session, a process through which I talked to 8 thoughtworkers. They take pride on their hiring process and now I understand why.<br><br>Now I'm just going through the bureaucratic side of things: gathering documents, certificates, translations - all in order to apply for my VISA, which can take up to 3 months to get ready. In the meantime, you can still find me here in Madrid, where I'll be celebrating with a few 'ca√±as'. Feel free to join me! ;)
