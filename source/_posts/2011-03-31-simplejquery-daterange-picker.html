As in many web apps out there, this week I needed a date range picker. I shopped around and while I did find a couple of good options they were (a) too clunky and (b) didn't prevent you from selecting invalid ranges. The latter being the one I was really interested in.<br><br>So I coded up something simple that worked and looked nice and decided to share around. It's the <a title="jquery-daterange-picker" href="http://github.com/leonardoborges/jquery-daterange-picker">jquery-daterange-picker</a>. Its only dependencies are <a title="jQuery" href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a title="jQueryUI datepicker " href="http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker">jQueryUI's datepicker</a>.<br><br>Got <a title="jquery-daterange-picker" href="http://github.com/leonardoborges/jquery-daterange-picker">get it</a>, <a title="jquery-daterange-picker" href="http://github.com/leonardoborges/jquery-daterange-picker">fork it</a>, <a title="jquery-daterange-picker" href="http://github.com/leonardoborges/jquery-daterange-picker">contribute to it</a> or <a title="Examples" href="http://leonardoborges.github.com/jquery-daterange-picker/demo/index.html">check out some examples</a>.
