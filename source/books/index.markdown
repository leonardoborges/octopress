I consider reading to be part of my duties as a Software Developer.
Therefore, I'll try and keep here an updated list of what I've been reading lately.

All books on this page helped in some way to improve my skills and become an overall better professional, and that's why I feel confident recommending them.

Occasionally I might include books I read years ago if I think they're worth it. This list will probably be under permanent construction... ;)
