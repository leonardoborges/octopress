I am fortunate enough to be able to call myself an author.  I published my first book [Clojure Reactive Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Reactive-Programming-Leonardo-Borges/dp/1783986662/) in 2015 and it's available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Reactive-Programming-Leonardo-Borges/dp/1783986662/).

In addition I spend a considerable amount of my personal time reading - this habit makes me a better professional and, more importantly, a better person. If you're curious about what I'm reading the widget below will give you a glimpse. Or you can just visit my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13699066.Leonardo_Borges).
