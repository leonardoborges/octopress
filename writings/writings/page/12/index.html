	<h1 class="title"><a href="/writings/2008/02/18/openid/">OpenID</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>
I think I&#8217;ve been really lucky lately. In my new job I&#8217;m getting to work with many interesting things and <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> is just one of them.<br><br>We are investing high in Ruby on Rails and we have now a few internal applications in development stages. Our manager wanted the ability to let people log in to our rails applications(for now) using their OpenID accounts.<br><br>It was a funny task, as I knew very little about OpenID. The idea actually is really good. Instead of creating a new user account on each new service/site you&#8217;d like to subscribe to, you create a single user account in a OpenID provider - like <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/">MyOpenID</a> - and use this identity to authenticate yourself in the services/sites that support this protocol.<br><br>What do we earn from that? Well, in my opinion, we can get a couple of benefits:<br><br>- You don&#8217;t need to memorize 723 logins and 723 passwords (if you really care about creating different passwords for all of your user accounts)<br><br>- You don&#8217;t authenticate yourself to the service you&#8217;re attempting to use. This service actually asks to your provider if your identity is valid, and you authenticate yourself there. Nowhere else.<br><br>I strongly recommend you visit the <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> to understand more about it.<br><br>But, back to the problem, we needed to put it working in a rails app. And that&#8217;s when I found the <a href="http://openidenabled.com/ruby-openid/">ruby-openid</a> library, provided by <a href="http://openidenabled.com/">OpenID Enabled</a>.<br><br>It is a complete library, really well documented that provides an abstraction layer both for consumer and server applications.<br><br>My first step was to develop the consumer. That&#8217;s what you need if you are going to provide your users with OpenID authentication in your web site. The ruby-openid library comes with several samples that really helped me out here. They were developed using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby On Rails</a> and are a really good start point.<br><br>After this step, I was asked to evaluate the possibility of being a OpenID provider. At first I thought it would be a really complicated task, but again this ruby library had a great example of a simple provider. The drawback is that the samples were developed in an older version of Rails ( &lt; 2.x ) . So I had to freeze the Rails version to 1.2.5 so I could run the provider sample code.<br><br>I am now working on porting this code to Rails 2.x, into one of our applications and it&#8217;s been flowing well so far. Just wanted to share this library for those of you trying something similar. It is really worth a look.

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/writings/2008/01/17/dbunit-and-hibernate/">DBUnit and Hibernate</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>
I never paid too much attention on testing database stuff. While working with java, the closest I got to something <em>workable </em>was using the test case abstractions provided by the Spring framework. It ensures that each test method runs in its own transaction that is rolled back after the test&#8217;s execution.<br><br>Fair enough. I used the <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/junit/framework/TestCase.html#setUp()">setUp()</a> method on my <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/junit/framework/TestCase.html">TestCase</a> to configure some records so I could work with them, removing all of them in the <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/junit/framework/TestCase.html#tearDown()">tearDown()</a> method. It was quite simple and worked.<br><br>But I always felt something strange with this solution. First of all, I had to add another framework just for that. - Actually I was using spring for dependency injection, but if I wasn&#8217;t, it wouldn&#8217;t be a nice option. And another thing that bothered me, is that you cannot guarantee that your database is in a known state.<br><br>After I started to work with Ruby - and Rails - I discovered the <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/chapter/26">testing fixtures</a>. It is a really nice way to set up your testing data without having to worry about your database state. - If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, follow the above link first.<br><br>Then I received a message from a co-worker saying he was having some trouble in using <a href="http://www.dbunit.org/">DBUnit</a> with Hibernate, and asked for some help. I&#8217;ve heard of DBUnit before but never tried it myself. It was a very good opportunity to take a better look into it.<br><br>The basic idea after all is very similar to that of the Rails Fixtures: You have some sort of external file - XML in this case - where you set up the testing data. So the framework takes care of erasing the database, inserting your test data and returning it to its original state.<br><br>So far so good, DBUnit&#8217;s default Classes works with <a href="http://www.dbunit.org/apidocs/org/dbunit/JdbcBasedDBTestCase.html">JDBC,</a> <a href="http://www.dbunit.org/apidocs/org/dbunit/DataSourceBasedDBTestCase.html">DataSources</a> and <a href="http://www.dbunit.org/apidocs/org/dbunit/JndiBasedDBTestCase.html">JNDIDatasources</a>, but not with Hibernate.  The effort to put them working together is minimal and is documented in their web site.<br><br>I decided to share how this can be done with hibernate and in the end, you would have a test case similar to this one:<br><br>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>
<strong>[2008/04/30] Update:</strong> The ibm_db gem has been updated to support the new Rails 2.0 style migration. Now you can just use t.xml and it will work. Look <a href="http://rubyforge.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=24055">here</a> for more info. Thanks to Mario Briggs for pointing me to the update.<br><br>&#8212;<br><br>In my new job we work with XML data natively stored on DB2. I have done some test with Rails and DB2 a few weeks ago and it&#8217;s pretty interesting, specially the easiness that Rails deals with XML.<br><br>We decided to test some new features of DB2 9.5 and I decided to test them with Rails 2.0.<br><br>So I created a new Rails app, configured the database.yml to use the <a href="http://db2onrails.com/2007/10/17/ibm_db-gem-updated-to-090/">idm_db</a> gem and fired:<br><br><code>$ rake db:create</code><br><br>The output is nice but, the database isn&#8217;t there! I suppose it&#8217;s something with the gem that needs to be updated. But really don&#8217;t know about it. It just doesn&#8217;t work. But this will not hold us down. I will just create the database by hand and keep going with my tests.<br><br>After that, I created a new model <em>XmlDocument,</em> which has a column named <em>data</em>, of type XML. According to the new migrations syntax, my model&#8217;s migration would look something similar with this:<br><br><code>class CreateXmlDocuments &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration<br>def self.up<br>create_table :xml_documents do |t|<br>t.xml :data<br>t.timestamps<br>end<br>end</code><br><br>def self.down<br>drop_table :xml_documents<br>end<br>end<br><br>Right? Ok, I fired up a terminal and lauched:<br><br><code>$ rake db:migrate</code><br><br>The output? Here it is:<br><br><code>== 3 CreateXmlDocuments: migrating ============================================<br>-- create_table(:xml_documents)<br>rake aborted!<br>undefined method `xml' for #<br></code><br><br>Yes, a big nice exception! The new migration syntax doesn&#8217;t allow you to do <em>t.xml</em>! But please don&#8217;t ask me why! :p<br>The solution? Well, although it&#8217;s weird - imo - , it&#8217;s also easy. You can mix the new and the old syntax in the same file. So our model&#8217;s  migration  will now look like this:<br><br><code>class CreateXmlDocuments &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration<br>def self.up<br>create_table :xml_documents do |t|<br>t.column  :data, :xml<br>t.timestamps<br>end<br>end</code><br><br>def self.down<br>drop_table :xml_documents<br>end<br>end<br><br>And that&#8217;s it! We&#8217;re ready to go! I didn&#8217;t find anything else different so far, besides what I described here. Hope this helps!

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>
Following the Rails 2.0 hype, I&#8217;ve been playing around with it and decided to share a first impression: Scaffolding is gone!<br><br>But wait, before you knock your head against the wall, let me tell you something: I lied :)<br><br>Scaffolding is not really gone. It&#8217;s just changed a bit.<br><br>How can I tell? Well, as a good developer I thought: &#8220;I&#8217;ll just create a scaffold with the new version and see what&#8217;s different&#8221;<br><br>I fired up a terminal, created a news rails application and generated a new model:<br><br><strong><code>$ script/generate model Contact name:string email:string</code></strong> - yes you can do this in rails 2.0, and these fields get into your model&#8217;s migration!<br><br>Now the I have a new model, it&#8217;s time for a controller to manage it:<br><br><strong><code>$ script/generate controller Contacts</code></strong><br><br>So your controller would look something like this huh?<br><br><strong><code>class ContactsController &lt; ApplicationController<br>scaffold :contact<br>end</code></strong><br><br>Well, too bad! The method scaffold is gone from ActionController::Base! And I&#8217;m not lying this time!<br><br>Now that the dynamic scaffold is gone, we&#8217;re left with the static one.<br>Ok, let&#8217;s try it then:<br><br><strong><code>$ script/generate scaffold contact</code></strong><br><br>And it won&#8217;t work again! ;) At the end of the output, you will get something like this:<br><br><code>Another migration is already named create_contacts: db/migrate/001_create_contacts.rb</code><br><br>It really means that if your model is meant to be used by a scaffold, you better generate it in the same line. It will fail, afaik, if the model previously existed. Destroy yout model and controller, and execute the following:<br><br><strong><code>$ script/generate scaffold Contact name:string email:string</code></strong><br><br>Done! Just run your migrations, startup your server and your new scaffold in rails 2.0 will be working gracefully!<br><br>It took me a while to discover this changes because I didn&#8217;t find it well documented. But maybe I was not looking in the right places. :)

<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">Dependency injection</a> - <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">DI</a>Â - Â is a great thing. Really. The hability to tweak implementations without touching your code is awesome and the DI frameworks, like spring, saves you a lot of coding.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>
Well, we all know how hard, or at least cumbersome, it can be to set up a production environment to deploy your applications. Besides all the hardware stuff like storages, links, routers you are still left with a huge amount of software configuration to handle. This often includes configuring things like clusters, load balancing and services monitoring - Including notification of interested parts in case of any failure. Pieces of software you have to tie up and make them work together.<br><br>But hey, ruby lovers, you may have a better way to get this going! Released by <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/" title="TW's web site">ThoughtWorks</a>, <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/rubyworks" title="RubyWorks">RubyWorks</a> is, as quoted from their website, a production application stack for <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby On Rails">Ruby On Rails</a> applications. I decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.<br><br>First of all I didn&#8217;t want to mess with my actual configuration so I installed a new vm with <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" title="Virtual Box">Virtual Box</a>. It has Ubuntu 7.10 on it, with 256MB of memory.<br><br>After installing RubyWorks - instructions on their website -, you get a new skeleton rails app up and running, being served by 4 <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/" title="Mongrel">mongrels</a> that defaults to production environment! Impressed? There is more. A <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu/" title="HAProxy">HAProxy</a> is also set up in front of your mongrel servers acting as a load balancer.<br><br>Well, you probably want to monitor all that stuff huh? A <a href="http://www.tildeslash.com/monit/" title="Monit">monit</a> web interface is waiting for your call on port 2812! It monitors all your mongrel servers - four by default - and your HAProxy, allowing you to measure CPU and Memory usage, among other things.<br><br>The coolest thing here is that all these softwares you would have to setup by hand are already working together, ready for production! Well, is it?<br><br>Going a little deeper, I deployed a database backed application to test this stack&#8217;s performance.<br><br>I used <a href="http://www.joedog.org/JoeDog/Siege" title="Siege">Siege</a> to stress the app and I am very happy with the results! I compared it with a single mongrel running on production env and no proxy at all.<br><br>It is worth mentioning that having 4 mongrels running took my vm to 77% of memory usage, while a single mongrel took it to 38%.<br><br>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>
At least, dumb for the companies hiring them. The old dream is still for sale out there: Build a &#8220;I do everything framework&#8221; and hire a bunch of dumb programmers - monkeys? - and you shall make money easily!<br><br>Just put some button pressers and a full featured enterprise system will be waiting on the other side of this &#8220;machine&#8221;!<br><br>C&#8217;mon, I thought this dream was over! We&#8217;ve had enough proofs that this doesn&#8217;t work!<br><br>Why? Because a framework, system builder, code generator or what you may want to call this thing just can&#8217;t do everything. And if you try to build this &#8220;monster&#8221; you will get yourself a hell of a problem:<br><ul><br>	<li>Your product will never be ready.<br>Or you think that &#8220;everything&#8221; has limits? Someone will always say: Hey, let&#8217;s put this new feature right there&#8230; it&#8217;s so small&#8230;.</li><br>	<li>Your product will not work well.<br>Bugs! Bugs! Bugs! I&#8217;ve never knew a team that has written enough tests building such a monster. Be prepared! If it&#8217;s never ready, you will always be in a rush!</li><br></ul><br>But ok, even if you manage to develop this &#8220;framework&#8221; and hire a bunch of monkeys to press its buttons, that&#8217;s when the worst problem arise. (At least worst in my opinion)<br><br>With this &#8220;philosophy&#8221;, you assume that you want to hire low level programmers that don&#8217;t need to learn anything new besides how to use your full-fledged systems generator. And who the hell likes to work in a place like that?<br><br>You take from your employees all the joy of development, which is about creativity. All about putting your brain to work. And sooner or later, they will notice that and just quit. You will never be able to stablish a trustworthy relationship within your team as well as to motivate them.<br><br>How will you motivate a team by telling them they will learn a new framework that isn&#8217;t used anywhere else in the world and that they will not improve their thinking?<br><br>They will become bored. And if not, man, I wouldn&#8217;t like to have someone like that in my team.<br><br>The problem is that managers usually love the idea to build huge enterprise systems at low costs. And some consultants sell this idea quite well.<br><br>I prefer to have trustworthy people in my team. Provide an environment that promotes learning. Let their creativity flow. Only with this approach you will have a first class team of developers producing, happily, high quality enterprise systems.<br><br>That&#8217;s the message for the companies out there: Software development IS a creative process. Promote learning. Let them create.

		<p>
Although the title might look dramatic, it&#8217;s pretty close to what I&#8217;ve been through.<br><br>I have set up a Ubuntu 64 bits on my laptop last week to do some tests with Ruby and DB2. Oh man, it is not complicated, is it? It shouldn&#8217;t be, actually.<br><br>Too sad that I found <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2007/11/14/guide-to-setting-up-the-ibm-ruby-and-python-drivers-for-db2-on-linux-32-or-64-bit/" title="Antonio Cangiano's Blog">this</a> so late! It&#8217;s a post from a friend, <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/" title="Antonio Cangiano's Blog">Antonio Cangiano</a>, describing the most common problems you may find trying to set up this environment (Linux + Ruby + DB2). You will probably get it working the first time, if you read it <strong>word</strong> by <strong>word</strong>. But if not, here are some extra tips that I can share with you.<br><br>- If you installed Ruby using your distribution&#8217;s package manager, remove all ruby packages completely. After that, install ruby exactly as described in Antonio&#8217;s <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2007/11/14/guide-to-setting-up-the-ibm-ruby-and-python-drivers-for-db2-on-linux-32-or-64-bit/">post</a>, typing this in the console:<br><pre class="rubycode"><code>$ sudo apt-get install build-essential<br>$ sudo apt-get install ruby-full rubygems</code></pre><br>After that, you may try again.<br><br>- Another problem I found was after getting the driver built. I have written a simple program to try the connection and got this message:<br><br><strong>Failed to load IBM_DB Ruby Driver</strong><br><br>The thing is that this error really means it was not able to find the file libdb2.so.1 in the /usr/lib directory. Issuing this command may settle things for you - it will create the missing symbolic link:<br><pre class="rubycode"><code>$ ln -s /opt/ibm/db2/V9.5/lib64/libdb2.so.1 /usr/lib</code></pre><br>Good luck!

		<p>
Well, talking with some friends, I decided that, from now on, I shall only write in english on this blog.<br><br>Of course some of you may not like it. But I think it has more advantages than the other way around.Â  I have some friends around the world, including people from the U.S., Spain, Italy, China, India and Australia. This way, they can also enjoy the content of this blog and help me improve it.<br><br>I will keep writing on the same subjects, so feel free to comment, as always. You may comment in the language you like more - hey, I can&#8217;t read Japanese! - but english is highly preferable! ;)<br><br>Thanks and see you on my next post!
