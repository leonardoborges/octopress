    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been working fulltime with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> for a while now and I've noticed a pattern of commands that emerge every so often, but not often enough that would make me remember them.</p>

<p>That's why I decided to post them here so I know where to look in the future. And of course they can turn out to be useful to someone else too.</p>

<p>So without further ado, here they are:</p>

<p>``` bash</p>

<h1>undo last commit</h1>

<p>git reset HEAD^</p>

<h1>show files in a given commit</h1>

<p>git show --pretty="format:" --name-only rev_number</p>

<h1>remove untracked files and directories</h1>

<p>git clean -f -d</p>

<h1>track remote branch</h1>

<p>git branch --track branch_name origin/master</p>

<h1>given you created a new local branch 'branch_name'</h1>

<h1>pushes 'branch_name' to 'origin/branch_name', creating the remote branch for you</h1>

<p>git push origin branch_name</p>

<h1>delete remote branch</h1>

<p>git push origin :remote_branch_name
```</p>

<p>I'll keep this list up to date and add more useful stuff as need arises. Enjoy.</p>

For those who don't know <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> is a version control system developed  by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank">Linus Torvalds</a>. It's main difference from other tools like SVN and CVS is the fact that it's distributed.<br><br>Recently I gave a workshop about Git here at the company where I walked through the most common cases I usually see when working in a team and thought about posting a summary of the commands used in the workshop.<br><br>It turns out that just this morning I found <a href="http://ktown.kde.org/~zrusin/git/git-cheat-sheet-medium.png">this - a.k.a the rest of my post</a>. It's a really nice and concise Git Cheat Sheet that covers most of what I talked aboutÂ  in the workshop. So I highly recommend you bookmark it. It will certainly be useful.
