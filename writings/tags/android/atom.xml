    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week our current client - <a href="http://ninemsn.com.au/">ninemsn</a> - ran the 3rd edition of their HackDay.</p>

<p>It's akin to Atlassian's <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/shipit-day">ShipIt</a> days so if you're not familiar with the concept, you should check their page but here's the gist:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We're given 24 hours to work on whatever we like as long as it's related somehow to the business</p></li>
<li><p>We're also free to use any technology we want</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The team consisted of <a href="https://twitter.com/romainprieto">@romainprieto</a>, Pranav Raja, <a href="https://twitter.com/thepaddedcell">@thepaddedcell</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stewgleadow">@stewgleadow</a> and myself (<a href="https://twitter.com/leonardo_borges">@leonardo_borges</a>).</p>

<h3>The idea: Cool story, bro!</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/romainprieto">@romainprieto</a> came up with it:</p>

<ul>
<li>A mobile app that could scan QR codes on a printed <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview/">JIRA</a> story card and provide features such as assigning a card to yourself, moving it between columns and adding comments to it.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is a common need. Most people will manage their stories in some sort of software such as JIRA. But it's also common to have a physical story wall.</p>

<p>The problem then is keeping them in sync. It's all too common for people to move the cards on the well and forget all about JIRA.</p>

<p>Well, not anymore. This is exactly what our HackDay project tackles.</p>

<p>In 24 hours, we built two native mobile applications - Android and iPhone - that are able to scan QR Codes printed on the story cards and, through integrating with the JIRA REST API, provide all the necessary functionality needed for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assigning a story to yourself - whoever is logged in to the app</li>
<li>Moving the story between states - e.g.: In Analysis, Resolve Issue, Reopen Issue etc...</li>
<li>Adding comments to a given story</li>
</ul>


<p>All code is <a href="https://github.com/ninemsn/cool-story">open source and on github</a>. <a href="https://github.com/ninemsn/cool-story">Check it out</a>! - and bear in mind this was written in 24 hours... ;)</p>

<p>We didn't stop there though. We actually finished early and had a couple of hours to spare so we shot a video - yes, a video!!! - about the app. I'm telling you, this is Hollywood quality:</p>

</script>

Enjoy! :)
