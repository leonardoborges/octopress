    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year and four months ago <a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2014/12/27/staring-a-new-chapter/">I joined Atlassian</a> to pursue a very exciting opportunity: to deliver realtime collaborative editing to Confluence. I have talked about it last year at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QR8meTrh5g&amp;index=16&amp;list=PLZdCLR02grLoBx0Y5ZrpdmLxc160PIwzQ">EuroClojure</a> and this year at <a href="http://qconsp.com/presentation/colabora%C3%A7%C3%A3o-em-tempo-real-com-clojure-e-clojurescript%E2%80%8B">QCon Brazil</a>. Even <a href="http://www.cognitect.com/">Cognitect</a> wrote <a href="http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2015/7/21/atlassian-builds-realtime-collaboration-services-with-clojure">a few words about it</a>.</p>

<p>In a nutshell this involved writing Clojure code all day to build an awesome service we call Synchrony. Synchrony is capable of realtime data synchronisation - not just collaborative editing - and as such its applications are many! This has been proven again and again internally during the Atlassian ShipIt hackatons, and externally via <a href="https://enso.me/">Enso.me</a>, which is powered by Synchrony.</p>

<p>Throughout this journey I took on more responsibility and transitioned into the Development Team Lead role. This gave me the opportunity to help drive the product roadmap and vision within the company in addition to leading a very capable team. What an amazing learning experience it has been!</p>

<h3>Today</h3>

<p>Fast-forward to today and collaborative editing is finally being used by real customers as part of our early access program! It's been a great journey and we have achieved a huge milestone!</p>

<p>For a more up to date look at Synchrony I highly recommend <a href="https://twitter.com/draftkraft">Haymo Meran</a>'s presentation at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgCYd6ei7QI">this year's AtlasCamp</a>. Haymo is a friend and one of the original founders of Wikidocs, the company where the technology behind Synchrony was originally developed.</p>

<p>I'm really proud of what we have accomplished and it's a great moment to look for a change, again :)</p>

<h3>The future</h3>

<p>Yes, I am leaving Atlassian - last day is June 17th. I'll be moving on to a new opportunity about which I'm really excited. But that is the subject of another blog post :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>In the beginning</h2>

<p>Nearly 4 years ago I founded the Sydney Clojure User Group. I had been playing with Clojure for a little while
and started a small study group to learn more. Initially this group was private and held at the ThoughtWorks office.</p>

<p>After a couple of meetups and conversations I decided to open up the group to the public and then realised we weren't the only ones interested in Clojure and, even more important, interested in meeting like-minded people, share experiences and help each other.</p>

<p>Back then none of us used Clojure for anything serious. Apart from Steve. Steve is a brave man and was building his new startup on top of Clojure. This was a great source of inspiration and learning for all of us. Steve hired Harry and Harry told us first hand what using Clojure for work could be like.</p>

<p>For all of us hobbyist Clojurists, this was a great start.</p>

<p>Since then we've held 37 meetups with an average of 22.25 attendees per meetup. These numbers won't impress many people, no doubt about that. What is impressive however is how it's changed over the years.</p>

<h2>Where are we at?</h2>

<p>Last December I sent out a survey and the result for one of the questions made me smile. The question was: <em>Do you currently use Clojure in your day job?</em></p>

<p><img class="center border" src="/assets/images/working-with-clojure-survey-results.png" width="541" height="195"></p>

<p>This is absolutely amazing. It's great to see how much the community has matured. Nearly 50% of meetup attendees currently work with Clojure in Sydney! I'm fortunate to say I can <a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2014/12/27/staring-a-new-chapter/">include myself towards this milestone</a>!</p>

<h2>Going forward</h2>

<p>We're now in 2016 and the group shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, we're picking up the pace a little and starting the new year with a new venue: from now on we'll be meeting at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a>!</p>

<p>I would like to thank ThoughtWorks for all the support in starting and running the meetup. I wouldn't have been able to do it if it wasn't for them.</p>

<p>See you at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/clj-syd/events/228691721/">next meetup</a>!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm extremely happy to let everyone know my book, <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/clojure-reactive-programming">Clojure Reactive Programming</a>, has finally been published!</p>

<p>You can get it at the <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/clojure-reactive-programming">publisher's website</a> or on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Reactive-Programming-Leonardo-Borges/dp/1783986662/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427205216&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Clojure+Reactive+Programming">Amazon</a>. I had a great time writing it and I truly hope you find it useful!</p>

<p>I've met a few authors here and there and I heard more than once that a book is never really finished. I now know what they mean.</p>

<p>The book doesn't cover everything I wanted to write about due to time and space limitations. Having said that, now that the book is out I do plan to expand on a few things using this blog.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who gave me feedback on early drafts of the book! :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past weekend - 19-20th of December - a group of highly motivated individuals gave up their Friday night and their entire Saturday simply to learn how to code in Clojure!</p>

<p>It was the first ever <a href="http://www.clojurebridge.org/">ClojureBridge</a> edition in Sydney and if you haven't heard of it before, its goal is to increase diversity in the Clojure community. It does so by offering free workshops targeted at beginners.</p>

<p>You should totally read <a href="http://juliangamble.com/blog/2014/12/20/why-clojurebridge-is-awesome/">Julian Gamble's post</a> about the event for details. He's was one of the volunteers on the day and has done a great job of describing his experiences.</p>

<p>I just wanted to take the opportunity to highlight and thank all volunteers who also gave up their time for free to help and coach 24 people eager to learn Clojure. They are: Alexandra Luca, <a href="https://twitter.com/claudionatoli">Claudio Natoli</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/juliansgamble">Julian Gamble</a>, Marcin Nikliborc, <a href="https://twitter.com/novemberkilo">Navin K</a>, Scott Robinson, <a href="https://twitter.com/svetixbot">Svetlana Filimonova</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/vineethvarghese">Vineeth Varghese</a>.</p>

<p><img class="left border" src="/assets/images/posts/clojurebridge_cupcakes.jpg" width="231" height="346"></p>

<p>Without you, the event would not have happened!</p>

<p>A big thank you to our main sponsor - <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> - who provided the venue, food, drinks and, of course, Clojure cupcakes.</p>

<p>Another big thank you to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> who gave some cool gifts to our attendees! (Sunnies and hats!).</p>

<p>Last but not least, a <strong>huge</strong> thank you to all attendees who were absolutely stellar and made the event an amazing experience!</p>

<p>I had a blast organising and running the event and hopefully we will have a new edition soon! I hope it ignited the desire to learn even more about Clojure and Functional Programming!</p>

<p>Happy holidays!</p>

<p>λ♥</p>

    <link href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2014/07/20/euroclojure-2014-and-clojure-reactive-programming/"/>

    <id>http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2014/07/20/euroclojure-2014-and-clojure-reactive-programming</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A bit late for a EuroClojure 2014 post but I suppose "better late than never" applies here.</p>

<p>The best part of every conference is the networking. Meeting new and interesting people is priceless and I did plenty of that - mostly over Polish beer and food. Polish beer isn't the greatest but if you must have it, better stick to Żywiec. It's widely available and was the one which didn't give me a headache :) - I've been told there are amazing microbreweries though I didn't get a chance to try any while in Krákow.</p>

<p>The food on the other hand was excellent every single time. But I digress.</p>

<p>There's no point in me describing the talks I watched as someone else has already done a
much better job of it: it's all <a href="https://gist.github.com/philandstuff/299cda371c7e74b03f18">in this gist</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/philandstuff">Philip Potter</a>.</p>

<p>I gave a talk titled <em>Taming Asynchronous Workflows with Functional Reactive Programming</em>. You can check out the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/borgesleonardo/functional-reactive-programming-compositional-event-systems">slides here</a>. The video will be available in  <a href="https://vimeo.com/100688924">this link</a> soon. I've received a lot of great feedback on it both at the event and afterwards through different channels. I'm really happy with how it turned out.</p>

<p>In this talk I mentioned publicly for the first time* that I am working on a book called <strong>Clojure Reactive Programming</strong> to be published by <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/">PacktPub</a>. It seemed appropriate to announce it here as well.</p>

<p>As of yet there's no set date but I'm spending most of my free time working on it. I'd say I have 55% of it done. Feel free to ping me directly if you'd like to know more. Alternatively you might want to follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/CljReactiveProg">twitter account I created for the book</a>.</p>

<p>There's not much there yet but I'll try and post book updates somewhat regularly.</p>

<p>See you around.</p>

<p>* <em>Strictly not true as I've announced it before but this was the first time for a wider Clojure audience and the first time captured on camera so there's no denying now ;)</em></p>
